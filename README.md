# Automatic-Subtitles-Synchronization

A project about learning how to synchronize subtitles in movies using machine learning.

## Description
This work approaches the topic of the Automatic Synchronization of a Movie’s Subtitle. Unsynchronized audio and subtitle files are common 
within streaming media. As subtitles often are an essential part of the viewing experience, this can have large consequences, possibly 
making the content inaccessible. Detection of the asynchronous subtitle and its synchronization are necessary in this case.

In this work five existing implementations are explored and tested in detail as well as a sixth one based on an existing implementation and 
modified by us. These implementations rely on artificial intelligence such as machine learning techniques and speech recognition.

You can find more details about our work in the report file and in each folder seperately. Each folder contains more detailed instructions/descriptions.

## What is included

- A folder to de-synchronize subtitles.
- A folder to evaluate a subtitle.
- A folder with implemantations which synchronize subtitles.
- A folder with our results testing the implemantation.
- A folder with our work to try to alter one implemantation and improve it.
